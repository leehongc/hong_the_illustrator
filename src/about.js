{"Hi, I’m Hong!  I was born in Taipei, Taiwan, and have been drawing and dreaming up stories since I can remember.  I am an illustrator/writer currently residing in California.  
Growing up, I have always been passionate about both art and biology and it was a tough decision to make when it came down to pursuing a major in University.  Ultimately, I earned my Master’s degree in Ecology.  I also realized later on that my love for art and biology doesn’t have to be mutually exclusive.  In fact, many of my illustrations and stories are inspired by animals and ecosystems that I have encountered.  I currently work as an engineer by day and a picturebook maker by night.  When I’m not working, I can be rock climbing, running, or cycling through all the trails that I’m lucky enough to have around me."}
